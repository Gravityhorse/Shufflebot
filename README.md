# Shufflebot
Simple fix for Windows 11's lack of proper shuffle function in Photos.
Code is in the txt file.

Windows 10 provided a shuffle function for slideshows in Photos, Windows 11 does not. Fixed that.

Program will prompt you to open any file on your desktop. It will then run a shuffled slideshow featuring every image in that folder.

Images will show in Fullscreen, aspect ratio can be toggled with R or Right Click. Play/Pause can be toggled with Spacebar or Left Click. Forward/Backward can be toggled by Right/Left arrow keys or Up/Down on the mouse scroll wheel.

Feel free to edit.
